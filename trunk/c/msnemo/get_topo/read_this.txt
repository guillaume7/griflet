To make get_topo work make sure you have in the same path the following files:

- earth_topo.nc
- 9x_u.cdf

Once it executes it will create a file that contains the same dimensions of 9x_u.cdf and the downscaled topography of earth_topo.nc under the netcdf variable "LANDMASK" named:

- topo.cdf
